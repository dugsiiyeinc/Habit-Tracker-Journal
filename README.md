Habit One - Habit Tracker and Journal

Habit One is a collaborative project by Naima and caaqil, developed as a web-based tool to help users establish and maintain healthy habits through structured habit tracking, journaling, and personalized analytics.

Project History

Initial Vision

Originally named Habits, the vision was to create an intuitive platform for tracking habits and personal growth with features such as habit tracking, journaling, and data analytics. The design was intended to be clean and calming, with a responsive layout and both light and dark themes. Local storage was used to save habit and journal data without requiring an account system, keeping user data private on their own devices.

Key Milestones

	•	Basic Layout & Core Features: Initial layout included sections for Habit Tracker, Journal, Analytics, and Leaderboard. Early navigation was established with a header, navigation links, and a basic footer.
	•	Local Storage Integration: Local storage was integrated to save user habits and journal entries, allowing users to retain data between sessions.
	•	UI Design and Theme Updates: Enhancements were made to provide a theme toggle (light/dark mode), responsive design, and mobile-friendly elements such as the hamburger menu.
	•	Analytics & Leaderboard: Interactive charts were implemented for analytics, showing habit completion trends and mood tracking.
	•	Export Data Feature: A JSON export feature was added, allowing users to download their habit and journal data.

Recent Changes (Today)

	1.	Rebranding the Logo and Name: The website’s branding was updated to Habit One. The new logo now features “HABIT ✔ ONE” and is prominently displayed in the header.
	2.	Enhanced Navigation: Streamlined navigation bar with updated links to different sections, and improved mobile responsiveness for smaller screens.
	3.	Updated README.md: Reflects the new logo, name, and includes detailed descriptions of all features and project history.
